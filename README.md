# ytf

ytf (youtube feed) will be a cli tool to follow your favorite channels distraction free.
Currently the program is in a exploration phase.

## plans/ideas to explore

* get the latest feed of channels you 'follow' and show the new ones (and the ones marked 'not viewed')
* allow actions to show only latest x videos (or something along this line)
* suggesting channels when trying to add a new channel, but you made a typo or don't know the exact channel name
* discovering channels (essentially the yt homepage, but less distracting/tempting/clickbaity)
	* get youtube homepage, grep the channgels and for each channel get the about and last feed (to get a sense of the content)
